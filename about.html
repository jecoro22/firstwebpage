## About

I'm Jes√∫s Copado, a 22-year-old student from Lanzarote. I study Software Engineering in the Complutense University of Madrid and this year I am studying the Philipps University of Marburg, as an Erasmus student. And thanks to this I'm starting this personal blog and website.

In my blog I talk about my stuff, the things I enjoy and the things I'm interested in. So you will find a lot of posts about movies, productivity, self-improvement, technology... Just scroll down a little bit more and you will find my last post and a link to all of them. I hope you find some valuable stuff there. Disclaimer: as I'm from Spain some of the posts are written in spanish.
